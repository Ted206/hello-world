# hello-world

HEllO all

I graduate as programmer but in truth for several years i was a web developer in Greece. So no programming. The last year i start watching that php and html 5 are something that companys are asking.. so i took out my books and start refreshing my knowledges.
According to a person from a search working office.. told me .. that cause of the reasson that my portofolium of my old websites.. are not longer active.. , i had to get here.. make an account.. and public my code. 
Still working with that. Well.. i don't know. Site is having as it sais.. more than 385 milion different codes. i wonder.. how i will make my own and the one that is not inside the one of 385.000.000? 
Unless.. i have to take a code.. that is already in.. even the simpliest as the "hello-world" and type it.. just to saw that i know how to type a php code.
If anyone will see that.. cause as i read sais that my subject is becaming public.. then i would like an advise... of what i suppose to write.
In my years that i finsihed the school.. nobody wanted as companys.. programmers. Money was at web pages in Greece/Athens. 
Nowdays.. still.. web developers are up.. but.. prices and salarys went way down. 
Here.. for someone to build a site.. they are giving top 200 euro.. and you must the administrator for the rest of your life. 
ps: i am talking as for private companys. like shops with cloths.. or food chains. but small one. 
Thanks for your time.. and hope.. that as the time will pass.. i will learn more about here.. and be able to use it normally
